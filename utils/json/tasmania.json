	"description": "Biteable is the world's simplest video maker. Tasmanian founders Simon Westlake, James McGregor and Tommy Fotak felt that anyone should be able to create wondrous animated videos just as easily as they could create a Powerpoint presentation. So they created Biteable, a simple platform which allows customers to build videos online, preview and share with their team before spending a cent. They now have over 2 million registered users and the platform is being used to create over 130,000 unique videos each month. The team have so far raised $1.1 million Seed funding and have recently opened an office in Melbourne."
